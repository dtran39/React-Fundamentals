1. Nested Components and Props in React
	- prop: a simple system for passing data from one component to another child component
		+ props are to components what arguments are to functions.
	- Array.prototype.map:
		it creates a new array, 
		calls our callback function on each item in the array, 
		and fills the new array with the result of calling the callback function on each item
	- render function can only return one element
		+ need to wrap a div if there are more than one element
2. Building UIs with Pure Functions and Function Composition in React
	- Funcitonal programming paradigm
	- Pure function: 
		+ Evaluates the same result given the same arguments
		+ Doesn't depend on and doesn't modify the states of variables out of its scope
	-> Advantages:
		- Easier to think about (no need to care about the state of the app)
		- Easy to test
		- easy to reuse
		- easy to reproduce the result
		- no side effects
	- slice vs splice:
		slice: create a copy and modify that 
		splice: modify the original array
3. Testing react component: FIRST:
	Focused
	Independent
	Reusable
	Small
	Testable
