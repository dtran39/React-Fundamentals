1. NPM: Node package manager:
	- allows you to easily manage different packages (modules) and keep track of which version you've installed
	- Npm comes with node
	Initialize npm project:
	+ npm init: create package.json:
		keep track of which packages or modules you've installed in your project
	+ node_modules: folder that contains package modules
	+ Npm scripts: create short alias to run long npm commands:
		Ex: 
		"scripts": {
    		"test": "ava 'app/**/*.test.js' --verbose --require ./other/setup-ava-tests.js"
  		}
  		So when you run "npm run test" your code will be tested in Ava
2. Webpack:
	- a code bundler
	- takes your code, transforms and bundles it, then returns a brand new version of your code
	- Why need it:
		+  you're able to tell it every transformation your code needs to make, 
		+ and it will do them and output a bundle file for you full of those changes 
		+ ex: jsx, es6, Sass/Less, CoffeeScript
	- 3 things webpack needs to know:
		+ entry point file
		+ what transformation to make
		+ output location
