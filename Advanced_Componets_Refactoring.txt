React is all about modularity.
  - As your render method grows,
    it's a good habit to take pieces and abstract them to new components.
  - Private component doesn't have this keyword associated
    + Removed the confusion of what context this is in
2. getDefaultProps:
  - specify what the default props will be in a component
    if those specific props aren't specified when the component is invoked.
    (like constructor for java, getInitialState for React state)
